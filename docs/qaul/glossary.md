## Node

Each device that participates in a qaul.net-network is called a 'node'. Each node has it's own cryptographic qaul-id, which is at the same time also the public key of a node.


## User

A qaul.net user is a person (or user-account) that communicates from a node. Each user has an own cryptographic id, and an own cryptographic-key to communicate securely. A user can therefore also change the node it is bound to.


## End-to-End Encryption

The content of direct communication messages are end-to-end encrypted. This means that it is encrypted directly from the sending user for the receiving user. The message can therefore only be decrypted with the private-cryptographic-key of the receiving user.


## User-Discovery

In order to find other devices in the network, qaul.net uses user-discovery methods. In local-area-networks, this user-discovery is done via the mDNS service.
